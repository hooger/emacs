* Emacs
This repository stores my Emacs related files, init file(s), custom libs.
These are:
- mathematica-navigation

** mathematica-navigation
This package was created to mimic the recursive block highlight functionality found in Wolfram Mathematica.

** install
Clone the repository
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/hooger/emacs
#+END_SRC
and add to your Emacs init.el (substitute my build path, ~/build/emacs, with the one where you cloned the repo)
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/build/emacs/")
(require 'mathematica-navigation)
#+END_SRC

** usage
The main functionality is to press C+. for highlighting the parenthesis blocks, but there is also a function (and hotkey: C+,) to go back to the last position before starting using said functionality.
They can be remapped like this
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-.") 'mathematica-navigation-highlight-parenthesis-block)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-,") 'mathematica-navigation-goto-position-before-highlight)
#+END_SRC
